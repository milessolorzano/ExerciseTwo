  <p>I am in this course because I want to finish college with my bachelors degree in computer science and work
    for a big tech firm. I self taught myself the basics of web development around 5 years ago so this course
    is a nice refresher on HTML, CSS, and javaScript. My main goal is to get better at writing
    javascript. </p>
