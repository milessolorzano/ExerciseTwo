  <p>This is the home page of my website about me.
    My name is Miles Solorzano. I like technology and like learning
    new things. I like jeeps, camping and coding. I got into computer science at one of my first jobs which was
    building websites using templates and it sparked my interest enough to go to school for computer science. </p>
  <p>There are also pictures you can see about what i do.</p>
